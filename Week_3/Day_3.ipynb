    "   - **Left pointer (`l`)** starts at the lightest person.\n",
    "   - **Right pointer (`r`)** starts at the heaviest person.\n",
    "3. Try to pair the lightest (`people[l]`) with the heaviest (`people[r]`):\n",
    "   - If their sum is within the limit ‚Üí board them together.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, the heavier person (`r`) goes alone.\n",
    "4. **Move the pointers** accordingly:\n",
    "   - If both boarded, move both pointers (`l++`, `r--`).\n",
    "   - If only the heavier one boarded, move just `r--`.\n",
