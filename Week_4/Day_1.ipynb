    "# Sliding Window Maximum\n",

    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to find the maximum value in every contiguous subarray of size `k` and return the result as an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "```\n",
    "nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Window position -> Max\n",
    "[1, 3, -1] -> 3\n",
    "[3, -1, -3] -> 3\n",
    "[-1, -3, 5] -> 5\n",
    "[-3, 5, 3] -> 5\n",
    "[5, 3, 6] -> 6\n",
    "[3, 6, 7] -> 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`\n",
    "- `1 <= k <= nums.length`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "To efficiently find the maximum in every sliding window, we use a **deque (double-ended queue)** to store indices of useful elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. **Use a Deque:** Maintain indices of elements in `nums` that could be the maximum for the current window.\n",
    "2. **Remove Out-of-Bounds Elements:** If the leftmost index is outside the current window, remove it.\n",
    "3. **Maintain a Decreasing Order:** Remove elements from the back of the deque if they are smaller than the new incoming element (as they wonâ€™t be needed anymore).\n",
    "4. **Record Maximums:** The front of the deque always holds the index of the max element for the current window.\n",
    "5. **Move the Window:** Slide the window by one position and repeat the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "- Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, making the solution **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since each element is pushed and popped from the deque at most once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)`, since the deque stores at most `k` elements at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- **Used a deque** to efficiently maintain max values.\n",
    "- **Maintained a decreasing order** in the deque.\n",
    "- **Time complexity was reduced to O(n)** by avoiding unnecessary re-computation.\n",
    "- **Optimal approach for large inputs** compared to naive `O(n*k)` brute force methods.\n",
